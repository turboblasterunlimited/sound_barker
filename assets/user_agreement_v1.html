  information to our Service Providers or they may collect it from you directly.
  We and our Service Providers may need to use your personal information in
  order to perform tasks between our respective sites, or to deliver content,
  features, services, or software to you. For example, payment information is
  collected by one of our Service Providers, and, if you pay by credit card,
  they may release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to
  confirm payment for products and services purchased through our Services.
  Although our treatment of your personal information is explained by our
  Privacy Policy, our Service Providers&rsquo; treatment of your personal
