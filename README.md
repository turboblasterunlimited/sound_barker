# K9_Karaoke -- frameBeforeMessage branch

Experiment with alternate workflow for card with no song.  After selecting dog, voice message is recorded, then frame.  Abandoned because it makes navigation unstable -- specifically introduces discontinuous paths though no crashes.  Deemed not worth it to find and fix bugs
